Advisers are appointed by each president with discretionary power. 
There are two types of advisors:
 (*) Presidential advisers (Have the rank of Minister)
 (*) State advisers (Have the rank of State Secretary)

Observations:

(1) Since the formation of the modern Romanian republic we have seen a steep increase in the number of presidential advisers, from 7 to a peak of 45 during Traian Basescu's first term
(2) Aditonally, an increase in the type of advisors, moreso, an increase in the State Advisers (which are the rank of State Secretary, one step below Presidential advisers), plus the creation of additional 'Personal adviser' roles.
(3) This underlines the stronger need for personal loyalties, potentially need for more political support.

To answer this question, we built a model in which corruption (our dependent variable) is determined by three explanatory variables:
